## We are so BACK newsletterees!!!
## /TG/ Monthly Newsletter #3
Welcome to the third /tg/ monthly newsletter!
This is a basic summary of all the going-ons and happenings in TGstation in the last month, along with any upcoming events and highlights.

## General Docket
I have returned! With the help of Ezel and after a long absence, I am pleased to have returned with the /TG/ Newsletter!
There has been some going ons within the upper management- namely there is no host role anymore. Scriptis is now a GameMaster, but will still work on server infrastructure. Timberpoes is still a GameMaster, but has been put in charge of managing blacklists.
In addition, we are now accepting donations again! This time- as a recognized 501c3 non-profit. You can donate at https://opencollective.com/tgstation13 . This means there is a lot more legal requirements for the money to be spent on tgstation, and books will be published regularly.

## Upcoming Events
The Headmin Election is just around the corner.. so be ready for that! No events are planned otherwise.
